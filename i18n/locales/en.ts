  marketIntelInfoBestLinesContent: "This shows you the absolute best odds available across all sportsbooks for this game. We scan dozens of bookmakers to find the highest payouts. For spreads and totals, we show the consensus number with the lowest vig (bookmaker fee). Using the best lines can save you hundreds over time.",

  marketIntelInfoConsensusLinesTitle: "Consensus Lines 📊",
  marketIntelInfoConsensusLinesContent: "The most common or average line across the entire betting market. This is what the \"market\" thinks is the fair line. If one book is way off consensus, it might signal value or a trap. Consensus is where most of the money is being offered.",

  marketIntelInfoPublicVsSharpTitle: "Public vs Sharp Meter 🌡️",
  marketIntelInfoPublicVsSharpContent: "Shows where professional bettors (sharps) are betting compared to casual bettors (public). Sharp money comes from professional bettors with proven track records. Sharps often bet against public favorites. The meter shows if there's a significant lean toward one side. A high score means sharps strongly favor one side.",

  marketIntelInfoMarketEfficiencyTitle: "Market Efficiency 🦾",
  marketIntelInfoMarketEfficiencyContent: "Measures how tight or loose the betting market is for this game. Tight market means all books agree - harder to find value. Loose market means books disagree - potentially more opportunities. We measure spread range (how much points vary) and price range (how much odds vary).",

  marketIntelInfoOddsTableTitle: "Odds Table 🔎",
  marketIntelInfoOddsTableContent: "A complete breakdown of every bookmaker's odds side-by-side. Compare all sportsbooks in one place, see which books are offering the best value, and spot outliers that might indicate value or errors.",

  marketIntelInfoVigAnalysisTitle: "Vig Analysis 🧃",
  marketIntelInfoVigAnalysisContent: "Shows the bookmaker's fee (also called juice or vig) on each bet type. Vig is the bookmaker's profit margin built into the odds. Lower vig means better value for you. Sharp books typically have 2-3% vig, while public books can have 4-5% or more.",

  marketIntelInfoFairValueTitle: "Fair Value ⚖️",
  marketIntelInfoFairValueContent: "What the \"true\" odds should be without any bookmaker margin. We remove the vig to calculate fair odds. This shows what you should actually be getting. If a book offers better than fair value, that's positive expected value (+EV).",

  marketIntelInfoEVOpportunitiesTitle: "EV+ & Arb Opportunities 💸",
  marketIntelInfoEVOpportunitiesContent: "Bets with positive expected value or guaranteed profit. +EV means positive expected value - over time, these bets make money. Arbitrage means betting both sides at different books for guaranteed profit. If none exist, we show the lowest vig options instead.",
